# Website Directory iOS App

This SwiftUI-based iOS app displays a list of websites loaded from a remote JSON source. Each entry shows the websiteâ€™s name, description, and icon. Users can open websites in Safari, search and filter entries, toggle between light and dark mode, and sort them alphabetically.

## Features

- Fetches and decodes website data from a hosted JSON file
- Displays name, description, and icon for each website
- Opens links directly in Safari
- Live search bar to filter websites by keyword
- Sorting toggle to view results alphabetically
- Light and dark mode support via toggle
- Fallback handling for missing or broken images

## SVG icon support

SwiftUI's built-in `AsyncImage` does not support `.svg` files. To address this, a custom `SVGImageView` was implemented using SVGKit. It loads, parses, and renders SVGs as `UIImage` objects that can be displayed in SwiftUI.

If an SVG fails to load due to a network issue or malformed structure, a fallback placeholder icon is shown. This prevents blank spaces or layout issues, and avoids crashes caused by rendering errors in CALayer.

Note: SVG support is functional but may exhibit bugs in some edge cases such as slow loads, malformed files, or CALayer render issues.
